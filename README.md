## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced using mixins throughout my SASS code and I am learning how important and useful they are in making sure I write DRY code. 


```css
@mixin spacing {
    margin: 20px 0;
    padding: 0 20px;
};
```
My CSS ```background``` properties knowledge was a bit rusty and this project helped me practice.

### Continued development

I'm hoping to practice more with other Frontend Mentor challenges
